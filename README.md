# Hi, I'm Lokesh Deshmukh! ðŸŒŸ

I'm an MTech student in ASMI at ABV-IIITM Gwalior, chasing that AI/ML dream. I love tinkering with Python to build robots that think, chatbots that surprise, and gadgets that just work. Currently geeking out on hybrid devices and sims that could change how we interact with tech.

## Stuff I'm Proud Of
- **Hybrid Stylus-Mouse**: Turned a simple pen into a mouse-stylus combo using Arduinoâ€”swipe to navigate, press for that perfect line in Photoshop. [Check the repo](https://github.com/yourusername/stylus-mouse).
- **DialoGPT Chatbot**: Fine-tuned Microsoft's DialoGPT for real-talk convos. It's got that witty edge for role-plays or quick Q&A. [Dive in here](https://github.com/yourusername/dialogpt-bot).
- **Path Planning Simulator**: ROS and Gazebo setup for robots dodging obstacles like pros. Early days, but it's my go-to for navigation experiments. [See the code](https://github.com/yourusername/path-planner).

## What I Bring to the Table
| Area | My Level |
|------|----------|
| Python & ML (PyTorch, Scikit) | Solidâ€”I've shipped models that predict and adapt. |
| Robotics (ROS, Gazebo) | Getting thereâ€”sims are my playground. |
| Hardware (Arduino, HID) | Hands-on beginner; love prototyping quirky inputs. |
