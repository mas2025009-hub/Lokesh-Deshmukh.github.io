# Hi, I'm Lokesh Deshmukh! ðŸŒŸ

MTech ASMI student at ABV-IIITM Gwalior, diving deep into AI and ML. I spend my days (and nights) coding Python solutions for crafting chatbots that feel alive, prototyping hardware like my latest stylus-mouse hybrid, and robotics still learning. It's all about turning ideas into tools that push boundaries. Currently geeking out on hybrid devices and ML models that could change how we interact with tech.


## Projects I'm Excited About
- **Hybrid Stylus-Mouse**: A pen-shaped device that handles mouse controls and stylus input seamlesslyâ€”built with Arduino for that intuitive PC interaction. [Repo here](https://github.com/yourusername/stylus-mouse).
- **DialoGPT Chatbot**: Fine-tuned for natural, multi-turn conversations; great for experiments in dialogue AI. [Explore it](https://github.com/yourusername/dialogpt-bot).
- **Path Planning Simulator**: Using ROS and Gazebo to simulate smart robot navigationâ€”still iterating, but the results are promising. [Code on GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername/path-planner).

## Skills Snapshot
